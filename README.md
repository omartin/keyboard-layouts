# Keyboard Layouts ~ optimized for French

This repo feature some Keyboards Layouts experiments since I was not satisfied with the way french accents are handled in Qwerty and Qwerty International on MacOS X : key shortcuts are cumbersome and tend to break your workflow. I came up inspired by [Qwerty Lafayette](http://qwerty-lafayette.org) with the modification of only 1 key : `;` which becomes a dead key for a fast access to the most used accents (left hand) and for other dead keys (right hand).

Once you hit the dead key, you'll get the following layout :

Thus you can simply type `;s` to output `Ã©` without leaving the home row.
